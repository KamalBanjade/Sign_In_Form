User Registration
Route: /api/register
Function: Registers a new user with email, username, and password.
Process:
Receives user details (email, username, password) from the client.
Hashes the password using bcrypt.
Stores the user information, including the hashed password, in the database.
User Sign-In
Route: /api/signin
Function: Authenticates a user with email and password.
Process:
Receives login credentials (email, password) from the client.
Finds the user in the database by email.
Compares the provided password with the stored hashed password using bcrypt.
If the comparison is successful, the user is authenticated. If not, an error message is returned.
Password Reset Request
Route: /api/passwordreset
Function: Initiates a password reset process by generating a token.
Process:
Receives the user's email.
Checks if the user exists in the database.
Generates a reset token and sets an expiration time for the token.
Saves the token and expiration time in the user's record.
Sends an email to the user with a link to reset the password, including the token.
Password Reset
Route: /api/passwordreset/reset-password
Function: Resets the user's password using the token.
Process:
Receives the reset token and new password from the client.
Finds the user by the token and ensures the token is not expired.
Hashes the new password using bcrypt.
Updates the user's password in the database.
Clears the reset token and expiration time from the user's record.
Issue Faced
Scenario:
User successfully registers and logs in.
User requests a password reset and receives an email with a reset token.
User resets the password using the token, and the new hashed password is stored in the database.
When the user tries to log in with the new password, authentication fails due to a password mismatch.
Observations:
The password comparison using bcrypt during login returns false, even though the new hashed password appears to be correctly stored.
This suggests an issue with how passwords are handled or compared after the reset process.
Debugging Steps Taken
Logging:

Added logs to display the received and stored passwords during sign-in.
Confirmed that the password reset correctly updates the hashed password in the database.
Direct Password Comparison:

Used a standalone script to manually compare the provided password with the stored hashed password.
Possible Issues
Password Handling:

Ensure passwords are correctly handled without extra characters or encoding issues.
Middleware:

Check if any middleware is altering the request data.
Environment Consistency:

Ensure the same bcrypt version is used in all environments.
Next Steps
Ensure Clean Password Handling:

Verify that passwords are correctly passed and received without unintended modifications.
Confirm Middleware:

Ensure middleware does not alter passwords or user data.
Use Minimal Scripts:

Isolate the password comparison logic to ensure it works as expected.
By thoroughly checking these aspects, you can pinpoint and resolve the issue with password comparison during the sign-in process.
